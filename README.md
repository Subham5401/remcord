<img src=".github/assets/rn-hz-logo.svg" alt="Remnote Horiz Logo" width="500">

A Discord RPC Connection to Remnote. Currently only works on Desktop!

## Usage

You can use RemCord with your Desktop installation of Remnote!

 <!-- Simply open Discord and run the `Connect to Discord Gateway` command on RemNote to begin the connection!
As you traverse RemNote, the extension will be automatically updating your presence. -->

1. Download and run the `RemCordHelper` application from the [releases](https://github.com/coldenate/RemCord/releases).
2. Open the Application and check for the `Connected to Discord` green light.
3. Open RemNote and download the RemCord Plugin from the [RemNote Plugin Store](TODO: ADD LINK).
4. If not already connected, run the `Connect to Discord Gateway` command on RemNote to begin the connection!
5. If the helper application is running, you should see the `Connected to RemNote` green light.
6. You're all set! Start studying!!

## Notice

> I am super new to Javascript and Typescript, so my apologies if this repo is a mess ðŸ˜…
> I am unaware of the ability to connect to Discord's RPC as an extension, so you need to download the Helper Application. It runs in the background and will always stay out of your way. All it does is listen for messages from RemNote on port 3000, and update your Discord Activity accordingly.
