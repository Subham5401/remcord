A Discord RPC Connection to Remnote. Currently only works on Desktop!

## Usage

* You can use RemCord with your Desktop installation of Remnote! *

1. Download and run the `RemCordHelper` application from the [releases](https://github.com/coldenate/RemCord/releases).
2. Open the Application and check for the `Connected to Discord` green light.
3. Open RemNote and download the RemCord Plugin from the [RemNote Plugin Store](TODO: ADD LINK).
4. If not already connected, run the `Connect to Discord Gateway` command on RemNote to begin the connection!
5. If the helper application is running, you should see the `Connected to RemNote` green light.
6. You're all set! Start studying!!
