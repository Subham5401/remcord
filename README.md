A Discord RPC Connection to Remnote. Currently only works on Desktop!

## Usage

You can use RemCord with your Desktop installation of Remnote! Simply open Discord and run the `Connect to Discord Gateway` command on RemNote to begin the connection!
As you traverse RemNote, the extension will be automatically updating your presence.

## Notice

> I am super new to Javascript and Typescript, so my apologies if this repo is a mess ðŸ˜…
> I am unaware of the ability to connect to Discord's RPC as an extension, so you need to download the Helper Application. It runs in the background and will always stay out of your way. All it does is listen for messages from RemNote on port 3000, and update your Discord Activity accordingly.
